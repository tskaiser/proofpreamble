\section{example 1: flow and indentation}

This example is meant to showcase how the prooftree
environment is built up.

\begin{prooftree}
                \AxiomC{1.1.1.1}
                \AxiomC{1.1.1.2}
                \AxiomC{1.1.1.3}
            \TrinaryInfC{1.1.1}
            \AxiomC{1.1.2}
        \BinaryInfC{1.1}
    \UnaryInfC{1}
\end{prooftree}
\begin{prooftree}
            \AxiomC{1.1.1}
                \AxiomC{1.1.2.1}
                \AxiomC{1.1.2.2}
                \AxiomC{1.1.2.3}
            \TrinaryInfC{1.1.2}
        \BinaryInfC{1.1}
    \UnaryInfC{1}
\end{prooftree}

I highly recommend using this indentation,
as it makes it easier to read.
For each fragment, UnaryInfC, BinaryInfC, TrinaryInfC,
and AxiomC they take a number of fragments above
themselves, flowing from bottom to top.

\section{example 2: labels}

This example showcases left and right labels.
As with the previous example evaluation
flows from bottom to top,
meaning the label declaration comes {\em before}
the line they belong to.

\begin{prooftree}
        \AxiomC{$<a_0, \sigma> ! n_0$}
        \AxiomC{$<a_1, \sigma> ! n_1$}
        \LeftLabel{EB-EqF}
        \RightLabel{$n_0 \neq n_1$}
    \BinaryInfC{$<a_0 = a_1, \sigma> ! \false$}
\end{prooftree}

\section{example 3: making assumptions}

This is how I make assumptions.

\begin{prooftree}
            \AxiomC{$\xi_1$}
            \noLine
        \UnaryInfC{$<a_0, \sigma> ! n_0$}
            \AxiomC{$\xi_2$}
            \noLine
        \UnaryInfC{$<a_1, \sigma> ! n_1$}
        \LeftLabel{EB-EqF}
        \RightLabel{$n_0 \neq n_1$}
    \BinaryInfC{$<a_0 = a_1, \sigma> ! \false$}
\end{prooftree}

Essentially, when you want to make an assumption, $xi_n$,
you make the ``root'' of the assumption an UnaryInfC
without a line using \textbackslash{}noLine,
followed by the assumption name in an \textbackslash{}AxiomC
fragment.
